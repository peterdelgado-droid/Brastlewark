This project uses Clean Code using SOLID principles.  
S: Single Responsibility Principle  
O: Open/Closed Principle  
L: Liskov Substituion Principal  
I: Interface Segragation Principal  
D: Dependency Inversion Principal  

Libraries Used:  
-Retrofit for now this seems the best to consume an API but I have a feeling GraphQL will take its place.  
-Glide for image rendering as it is the simplest to use.  
-Kotlin Coroutines are best for multithreading and avoid those pesky ANR explosions.  
-Timber for logging as you dont need TAGS  
-Koin for DI as it the best option for small project projects. The creation of extras classes is diminished greatly.  
-Material Design for search view.   
-JUNIT for unit testing.   
-Espresso for automated testing.
